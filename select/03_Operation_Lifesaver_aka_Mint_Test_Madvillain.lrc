[00:16.02] Now you caught me off guard
[00:18.17] Once you breath out
[00:19.31] Then she made me cough hard
[00:21.67] Contact the god and let him know to slip 2 in
[00:24.19] Fine. How are you doing?
[00:26.10] Can I get you a drink?
[00:27.38] This one's a shoe in
[00:28.81] Awkward situation that I'm on a mission to ruin
[00:31.33] Her big butt and smile was like camo
[00:33.42] Hit up the men's room, we need more ammo
[00:36.21] Watch your 3 o'clock, a new recruit
[00:38.68] That's her gin and Juicy Juice
[00:39.71] Use a stick of Juicy Fruit
[00:41.95] She just knew she was cute
[00:44.15] It's in her own best interest
[00:46.15] It's less stress
[00:46.96] Hit her with the "do you need a mint test"
[00:49.28] It don't matter if she's slim or dressed to impress
[00:51.52] I won't rest
[00:52.53] Fella's don't fess
[00:53.84] Some of 'em just need to eat the whole thing of Crest
[00:57.68] It's been a long day
[00:58.94] It's just how the song say
[01:05.80] I hope she don't take this the wrong way
[01:12.22] You need a mint test
